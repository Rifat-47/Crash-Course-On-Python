2.Question 2

Complete the script by filling in the missing parts. The function receives a name, then returns a greeting based on whether or not that name is "Taylor".
#solution:
def greeting(name):
  if name == "Taylor":
    return "Welcome back Taylor!"
  else:
    return "Hello there, " + name

print(greeting("Taylor"))
print(greeting("John"))


5.Question 5

If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?
#solution:
def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = filesize//block_size
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = filesize % block_size
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return block_size * (full_blocks + 1)
    return block_size * full_blocks

print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192
