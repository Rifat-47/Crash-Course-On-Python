2.Question 2

Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.
#solution:
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for x in range(1,n+1):
        result = result * x
    return result


for n in range(0,10):
    print(n, factorial(n))
    
    
3.Question 3

Write a script that prints the first 10 cube numbers (x**3), starting with x=1 and ending with x=10.
#solution:
for x in range(1,11):
  print(x ** 3)
  
  
4.Question 4

Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.
#solution:
for i in range(20):
    result= 7 * i
    if(result <100):
        print(result)
        
        
5.Question 5

The retry function tries to execute an operation that might fail, it retries the operation for a number of attempts. Currently the code will keep executing the function even if it succeeds. Fill in the blank so the code stops trying after the operation succeeded.
#solution:
def retry(operation, attempts):
  for n in range(attempts):
    if operation():
      print("Attempt " + str(n) + " succeeded")
      break
    else:
      print("Attempt " + str(n) + " failed")

retry(create_user, 3)
retry(stop_service, 5)
